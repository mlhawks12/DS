ALGORITHM ANALYSIS:
What's the order notation of your algorithm?
O((w*h*l*9) + s*a + s*f + (s *w *h*(blank_space)) + (s*a) + (s*f))
this is it because I do create_solutions, then delete duplicates, then delete invalid words, then place letters in blank spaces, then delete duplicates, and then delete invalid words.


TEST CASE SUMMARY:
How did your program perform on the different test cases?  Summarize
the running times.  (It's ok if it didn't finish the harder examples.)
